# PasteIT
PasteIT is a clipboard manager that simplifies copy-paste tasks and boosts your productivity. This intuitive tool allows you to easily store and access text with visual organization features. Say goodbye to repetitive tasks and hello to more time for creativity and work!

## About
PasteIT was born out of a friend's idea during a hackathon. We were constantly frustrated with the amount of copying and pasting we had to do, and how we lost track of important content in the endless sea of tabs. I decided to develop my own version of the idea and bring it to life. Be sure to check out my friend too, as I'm sure he'll release his own projects in the future! <a href="https://github.com/donoh5">@Donoh5</a>
